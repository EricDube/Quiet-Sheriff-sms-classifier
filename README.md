# fastai-text-classifier-server
A simple Flask server for a Fast.ai text classifier model. The server uses the pytorch `.pth` model to get around some bugginess with the `.pkl` generated by the learner export.

## Setup

1. Train your text classifier and save the model.
2. Copy the `.pth` model to the `models` directory.
3. Copy the `.csv` data to the `data/train` directory.

## Deploy
1. Follow the Fast.ai instructions for AWS Beanstalk: https://course.fast.ai/deployment_aws_beanstalk.html
